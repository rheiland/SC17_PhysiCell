# SC17_PhysiCell

A few scripts, images, input/output files, etc, related to https://doi.org/10.1101/196709 for http://www.scworkshops.net/cancer2017/.

The Anaconda Python 3 distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download) was used for the scripts that used numpy and/or matplotlib. The "pvpython" that was installed with the ParaView binary installation also (mostly) work. The version at the time of this repo's use (`$ pvpython --version` --> paraview version 5.4.1) seemed to be an earlier version of matplotlib than that in Anaconda's and apparently lacked one particular predefined colormap that was used in the "heatmap*" scripts. There may be other hiccups as well.
